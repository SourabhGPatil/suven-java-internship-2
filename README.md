# Inventory Management Project

We will create a home inventory management programme for this project. 
This programme allows you to keep track of your possessions.

The project for the Home Inventory Manager is now complete. Save and run the project to ensure it functions properly. Keep track of your belongings with the help of the programme. You'll want to delete the inventory.txt file in your project folder and start over with your own items and combo box elements.

Things we learned in this project -
1. Use of combo box control.
2. Basic object-oriented programming concepts and how to define your own classes and objects.
3. How to add printing to a project, including using the print dialog control.
